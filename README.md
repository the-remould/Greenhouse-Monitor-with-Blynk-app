# Pool-Heater
Solar Pool Heating System monitored and controlled by Blynk app...

3 waterproof sensors-
Sensor 1 is in the heater element on the roof, 2 is in the pool input tube, 3 is in the pool.
(This system has been running reliably for just under 1 year now. 

Next step is to add a solenoid valve which turns ON every time sensor 1 reaches 40C,
and then turns OFF when sensor 2 drops to 30C.
